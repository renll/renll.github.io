Hi! I am a third-year PhD candidate in the [Text Information Management and Analysis Group](https://timan.cs.illinois.edu/ir/), affiliated with the [Data and Information Systems Laboratory](https://dais.cs.illinois.edu/) at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Chengxiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/), and work with [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) and [Julia Hockenmaier](https://juliahmr.cs.illinois.edu/). I finished my master degree at University of California San Diego in 2020, advised by [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/), and my undergraduate degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2018, working with [Kai Yu](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/en/members/kai_yu).

My research interest generally lies in scalability and the interpretability aspects of Natural Language Processing, with their applications to Language Modeling, Information Extraction and Dialogue System. I am striving to answer the following research questions: 
* Can deep neural networks develop its own language (*i.e.*, sparse, structured and discrete latent representations) during large-scale self-supervised learning? 
* Can we leverage sparse latent decisions to improve generalizability, interpretability and scalability of the foundation models? 

In the past, I mainly worked on improving the generalizability [[EMNLP 18]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09587) and the scalability [[EMNLP 19]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00754) of dialogue state tracking for task-oriented dialogue system.

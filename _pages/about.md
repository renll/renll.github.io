Hi! I am a Member of Technical Staff at Microsoft CoreAI, and a PhD graduate in [Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) from [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Chengxiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/). I obtained my master degree at [University of California San Diego](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/) advised by Prof. [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/), and my undergraduate degree at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/) working with Prof. [Kai Yu](https://x-lance.github.io/kaiyu/).

My long-term research goal is to develop artificial neural architectures with superhuman efficiency and capacity, and to apply them toward discovering new structured knowledge from natural signals. I believe in two principles:

* "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." - Albert Einstein
* "Don't give up on the intuition until you figured out why it's wrong." - Geoffrey Hinton

Recently, I am interested in **large-scale pretraining** of frontier OpenAI models.

<!-- In the past, I mainly worked on improving the generalizability [[EMNLP 18]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09587) and the scalability [[EMNLP 19]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00754) of dialogue state tracking for task-oriented dialogue system.

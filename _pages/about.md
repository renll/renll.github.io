Hi! I am a third-year PhD candidate in [Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Chengxiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/), and work with Prof. [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) and Prof. [Julia Hockenmaier](https://juliahmr.cs.illinois.edu/). I finished my master degree at University of California San Diego in 2020, advised by Prof. [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/), and my undergraduate degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2018, working with Prof. [Kai Yu](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/en/members/kai_yu).

My research interests primarily focus on Scalable and Interpretable Natural Language Processing, with a specific focus on applications in Language Modeling, Information Extraction, and Dialogue Systems. My current research is aimed at answering the following questions:
* Is it possible for deep neural networks to develop their own language through large-scale self-supervised learning, resulting in sparse, structured, and discrete latent representations?
* Can we utilize these sparse latent representations to enhance the interpretability, generalizability, and scalability of foundation models? 

In the past, I mainly worked on improving the generalizability [[EMNLP 18]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09587) and the scalability [[EMNLP 19]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00754) of dialogue state tracking for task-oriented dialogue system.
